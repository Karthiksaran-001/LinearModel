# House Price prediction

This Is HousePrice in Boston Prediction Model Using Machine Learning
Linear Regression Model with Accuracy of 80%
- In This Model I Use To Scale the Value using StandardScalar(z-score)
- And Use To Add L1 , L2 Regression To Check the Model Accuracy 

- And To Drop One Feature Which is Highly Correlated

with code pipeline

  
## Complete DataScience Roadmap

- Get the Data From Kaggle 

- Split the Dataset for Train and Test to Avoid Data Leakage

- Read and Analysis the Dataset

- Check Missing Values and Their Distribution

- Check the MultiCollinearity Using Variance inflation factor (VIF)

-  Seperate Dependent and Independent Feature

- Start To Build Our Linear Regression Model

- Add Cross Validation Using Regularization(L1 , L2 , ElasticNet)


- Create a Sample App Using Flask

- Deploy on AWS ElasticBeanStalk
